# Phase 1 Audit: Home WebGL Source Parity

Last updated: 2026-06-05

## Scope

Phase 1 covers Home WebGL parity against the mirrored original bundle, not screenshot matching:

- `legacy-mirror/public/assets/bundle.250f01b7.js`
- `legacy-mirror/public/assets/bundle.87ba3613.css`

Primary source areas:

- `p1`: home work scene composition, lights, carousel, floor, environment, about/floating blocks
- `GA` / `VA`: project block instancing, standard material shader injection, local mouse simulation, reveal/alpha tail
- `T1` / `w1` / `E1`: thumbnail scene and strip render target
- `A1` / `C1`: main pre-composite material
- `OA` / `kA` / `Lu`: work render manager and final composite
- `Ka`: mouse simulation
- `Se`: visual state setter ownership
- `TD` / `Fg`: route-specific about/floating visual ownership

## Current Phase 1 Status

Phase 1 is QA-ready, but not complete enough to declare 1:1 until source-vs-rebuild visual QA is reviewed.

Estimated status:

- Architecture parity: 80-85%
- Shader/render-manager parity: 70-75%
- Final home visual parity: 65-70%
- Runtime stability: currently good based on build, marker checks, and Chrome CDP smoke across home, about, and two project pages

The rebuild now has the correct broad shape: `sceneWrap -> blocksWrap -> GA`, source-sized grids, MeshStandardMaterial with shader chunk injection, real `SpotLight.map`, thumb render target, A1/OA split composite passes, bloom mip chains, Ka-style ping-pong mouse simulation, floor/environment layers, and about/floating auxiliary blocks.

The remaining risk is mostly in fine-grained shader behavior, render pass ordering, source material details, and visual validation of the spotlight projection and mouse/fluid feel.

## Latest Source Audit Snapshot

This checkpoint narrows Phase 1 from a broad rebuild target into a short source-difference list.

| Area | Source evidence | Rebuild state | Current decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TD` about scroll opacity | `TD.onScroll()` updates spotlight every RAF and sets mobile `uScrollOpacity = Cs(scroll, 0, Pe.h * .25, 1, 0, true)`, while desktop stays `1`. | `updateAuxiliaryBlocks()` updates the about spotlight while visible and applies the same desktop/mobile opacity shape from `window.scrollY`. | Treat as implemented, pending real route/WebGL QA. |
| `TD` about spotlight ownership | Source switches `spotLight.map` to `J.characterScene.renderManager.renderTargetComposite.texture`, disables work spotlight parallax, and positions spotlight relative to `aboutBlocks`. | Rebuild switches to an offscreen character target, disables parallax, and positions/targets spotlight relative to about blocks. | Ownership is source-shaped; remaining gap is the target content itself. |
| `Fg` floating scroll velocity | `Fg.onRaf(e)` calls `floatingBlocks.update(e)` and then adds `.005 * abs(this.page.scroll.velocity)` to `floatingBlocks.translationZ`. | Floating z positions use time, source-shaped `translationZ`, and now accumulate `.005 * abs(scrollVelocity)` while the about floating blocks are visible. | Implemented, pending real route/WebGL QA. |
| `ZA` floating block z/hole behavior | `positionOnUpdate(e)` subtracts `translationZ`, wraps z into a 250-unit band plus `10`, and hides the center hole when `x > -3.5 && x < 3.5 && y < 5`. | Rebuild follows the same z wrapping, `translationZ` subtraction, scroll-velocity feed, and center-hole hide logic. | Implemented, pending real route/WebGL QA. |
| `P1-07` character scene | Source about spotlight map is rendered by the real character scene/render manager and rotatable character mesh. | Rebuild now renders `public/models/me/me.gltf` into the about spotlight target with a dedicated character camera and lights, while keeping the previous `model_T.jpg` composite plane as a fallback. | Implemented as a controlled source-aligned bridge; full source rotatable-character event handling/render-manager parity still needs real visual QA before deciding whether to expand scope. |

## Completed Source-Aligned Areas

| Area | Current state | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `p1` scene hierarchy | Source-shaped `homeScene`, `sceneWrap`, `blocksWrap`, floor, environment, about blocks, floating blocks. | High |
| `GA` grid structure | Source dimensions `35x23xLOW_RES?4:7`, cube size, spacing, scale, circular carousel placement. | High |
| `VA` material type | Rebuild now uses `MeshStandardMaterial + onBeforeCompile` instead of a full local shader. | Medium-high |
| Spotlight map ownership | Home uses thumb composite target; about switches to character target; parallax ownership is source-shaped. | Medium-high |
| Thumb scene | Source camera shape, square render target sizing, scale `(2,2,2)`, wrapping and visibility bounds. | Medium-high |
| Render manager shape | A1 pre-composite and OA final composite are separated; bloom uses five source kernels. | Medium |
| `Ka` simulation | Ping-pong render targets, source uniforms, source timing, shared screen-space simulation, and per-work-item local `GA` simulation targets. | Medium-high |
| About/floating blocks | Source-shaped block grids and route activation are present. | Medium |
| Project detail media stability | Smoke checks continue to pass; should not be changed during Phase 1 unless required. | High |

## Remaining Difference Audit

### Must Fix

No source-proven Phase 1 implementation gaps are currently classified as Must Fix. Phase 1 still needs source-vs-rebuild visual QA before it can be declared complete.

### Latest Browser QA

Chrome headless with SwiftShader enabled was used as the available local WebGL QA environment:

- Home `/?skip-preloader`: WebGL initialized, `.gl-canvas` covered `1440x900`, screenshot pixels were nonblank, 10 project cards remained present, and no failed network requests were reported.
- About `/about/?skip-preloader`: WebGL initialized, `.gl-canvas` covered `1440x900`, screenshot pixels were nonblank, `me.gltf` loaded, and no runtime errors were reported.
- Project `/gc-2026/?skip-preloader`: WebGL initialized, `.gl-canvas` covered `1440x900`, screenshot pixels were nonblank, desktop/mobile media markers remained `5/5`, and no failed network requests were reported.
- Project `/hashgraph-vc/?skip-preloader`: WebGL initialized, `.gl-canvas` covered `1440x900`, screenshot pixels were nonblank, desktop/mobile media markers remained `5/5`, and no failed network requests were reported.

This proves the local runtime smoke gate, not exact source visual parity. Remaining Phase 1 evidence should come from comparing the rendered home/about/project visuals against the mirrored source behavior.

### Source Comparison QA Harness

A local source-vs-rebuild screenshot pass is now possible with a controlled QA-only content fallback:

- original: `legacy-mirror/public` served on port `5175`
- rebuild: `dist` served on port `5173`
- fallback assets: `public/`
- content fallback: `ENABLE_CONTENT_JSON_FALLBACK=1` on `scripts/serve.mjs`

The fallback synthesizes Astro-style collection JSON for the original bundle's missing baked content requests, including `/src/content/projects/*.json`, `/src/content/awards/*.json`, `/opt/build/repo/src/content/projects/*.json`, and `/opt/build/repo/src/content/awards/*.json`. It reads from the rebuild's existing `src/data/projects.json` and `src/data/awards.json`, and it is disabled unless the environment variable is explicitly set.

After enabling the fallback and using Chrome SwiftShader, the mirrored original can naturally reach the post-preloader state on home and `/gc-2026/` by waiting for the source preloader CTA and clicking it. The diagnostic run reported:

- original home: preloader removed, full-viewport canvas present, no failed network requests, no runtime exceptions.
- original `/gc-2026/`: preloader removed, full-viewport canvas present, no runtime exceptions, only canceled media requests from video/image lifecycle cleanup.

This unblocks real source-vs-rebuild visual auditing. It does not complete Phase 1 by itself, because the first valid contact sheet still shows review-worthy differences:

- Home desktop: rebuild has a stronger centered WebGL vignette/scene glow and visible CTA while original is flatter/darker at the same capture time.
- Home mobile: rebuild shows a stronger central WebGL field than original.
- Project desktop: original and rebuild can now both be captured post-preloader, but media/composite timing still needs a longer page-specific pass before declaring parity.

Decision: continue with source visual QA before more WebGL tuning. Changes should target only differences that can be tied back to source code paths in `p1`, `GA/VA`, `T1/w1/E1`, `A1/OA/kA/Lu`, `Ka`, or `Se`.

### Implemented, Needs Real WebGL QA

| ID | Source area | Implemented state | Remaining evidence needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1-01 | `p1.update` / `GA.update` | Each `WorkItem` now owns local mouse simulation material, scene, ping-pong targets, UV target state, speed state, and visible-item update. | Real WebGL browser QA should confirm mouse interaction/performance, because the current headless Chrome environment failed WebGL probe creation. |
| P1-02 | `GA.createPlane` / `Ka` | Per-block ray-plane hits now update the matching work item's local `Ka` target, while shared screen-space `tMouseSim2` remains render-manager owned. | Same real WebGL QA as P1-01. |
| P1-03 | `VA` shader injection | Source `VA` fully replaces MeshStandardMaterial shaders. Rebuild intentionally keeps chunk injection to preserve the current Three lighting, color-space, fog, env-map, spotlight-map, and WebGL2 compatibility path while injecting source displacement, world-position correction, alpha, reveal, mouse-lightness, and mouse-simulation behavior. The remaining proven material flag gap (`dithering=true`) is now aligned on work and auxiliary block materials. | Full shader replacement remains a documented high-risk deviation and should only be attempted if real WebGL QA shows a specific visual/runtime mismatch that chunk injection cannot resolve. |
| P1-04 | `A1` / `OA` blend functions | A1 perlin/background blend and OA darken/lighten now call a source-shaped `sourceBlend(mode, ...)` dispatcher for modes `1`, `11`, and `15` instead of direct local helper calls. | Output should be equivalent, but real WebGL QA should confirm no shader/runtime differences and future work may still port the full source blend-mode table if needed. |
| P1-05 | `OA` final composite | Source audit confirmed final `OA` owns `uDarken/uSaturation`, so those final-pass visual states remain in place. `OA` final composite now carries source-shaped `toneMapped:false`, `transparent:true`, and `NormalBlending`; the A1/C1 pre-composite, luminosity, bloom composite, and FXAA screen materials now explicitly use source-shaped tone/blending flags where proven. | Browser QA should confirm no shader/runtime/color-management regressions; deeper shader math audit is still only needed if visual evidence shows remaining OA mismatch. |
| P1-06 | `Se` setter ownership | `showScene()` now follows source state tween behavior without a forced local reset; `setDarken`, `setSaturation`, `setContrast`, `setMediaBackground`, and `setDirectionalLight2Intensity` now tween local source-shaped state before writing uniforms/lights; composite uniform defaults are initialized from those state fields. Project entry is closer to source `OD`: visual init sets media opacity to `0` and media reveal is deferred to the page-enter boundary instead of running during WebGL visual-state setup. Home `SD.animateIn`-style scene reveal/gallery entry and about `TD/Fg.animateIn`-style auxiliary reveals are also deferred to the page-enter boundary instead of running during WebGL boot. About leave separates `TD/Fg.animateOut`-style reveal animation from `TD.destroy`-style immediate cleanup. Home route links outside the work gallery now route through the same work-gallery-out path as source `BD/zD` transitions. | Browser QA should confirm no cross-route visual regressions and no duplicate navigation/leave events. |
| P1-07 | Character scene | About spotlight map now comes from a rendered GLTF character target instead of only a flat `model_T.jpg` texture composite. The target uses the existing `public/models/me/me.gltf`, dedicated camera/lights, automatic framing, and fallback plane if GLTF loading fails. | Real visual QA should compare about spotlight projection and decide whether the remaining source `characterScene.renderManager` and `rotatableMesh` event behavior must be ported or can remain an accepted Phase 1 deviation. |
| S1-07 | `TD/Fg` scroll lifecycle | About `TD` opacity/spotlight lifecycle is source-shaped. Floating `ZA` z update now receives the source `Fg` scroll-velocity feed by accumulating `.005 * abs(scrollVelocity)` into `translationZ` only while the about floating blocks are visible, with entry/destroy resets to avoid cross-route carryover. | Real WebGL browser QA should confirm about scroll, resize, and route leave behavior because the local Chrome/SwiftShader WebGL probe is not reliable on this machine. |

### Should Fix If Source-Proven

| ID | Source area | Difference | Impact | Risk | Suggested batch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1-01 | `Lu` / `I1` render target options | Source render targets are default Three `WebGLRenderTarget` clones. Rebuild manually sets non-mipmapped linear/clamped on many targets. | Usually stable, but some filtering/wrap assumptions may differ. | Medium | Include only where source explicitly requires |
| S1-02 | `I1` lensflare/media/portal | Rebuild exposes no-op uniforms, but lensflare/portal paths are not fully implemented. | Home likely unaffected unless source enables these settings on target views. | Low-medium | Defer unless source settings show enabled |
| S1-03 | `k1` displacement scene | Rebuild has a source-shaped wavves/displacement target, but not a verified full source shader copy. | Work cube z motion and unrevealed wave depth may still differ. | Medium | 5-8 shader audit batch |
| S1-04 | `a1/o1/i1` floor | Floor reflection is approximated around source constants but not a full source material port. | Lower-viewport reflection may be visually different. | Medium | Nice isolated batch |
| S1-05 | `h1/u1/l1/c1` environment | Environment shader is source-shaped but simplified. | Background horizon/sky texture movement may be off. | Medium | Nice isolated batch |
| S1-06 | `T1/w1/E1` transition state | Strip wrapping and sizing are source-shaped; transition ownership may still differ during gallery leave/enter. | Thumb projection may flicker or lag differently around transitions. | Medium | Pair with gallery transition QA |

### Risky Or Needs Visual QA

| ID | Source area | Issue | Why risky |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1-01 | Full `VA` shader replacement | Replacing chunk injection with source full shader could improve parity but may break current Three 0.184 color-space/light/fog assumptions. |
| R1-02 | Per-block `Ka` simulation | More source-accurate but increases render targets and per-frame passes for 10 work items; must watch performance and memory. |
| R1-03 | Full character scene | Requires confirming original assets/GLTF path and render manager; could expand scope beyond home spotlight parity. |
| R1-04 | Full fluid sim | Source work scene has fluid disabled in `kA`; main/project managers may use fluid differently. Enabling more fluid without source proof can create non-source behavior. |
| R1-05 | Visual tuning after source fixes | Screenshot tuning before source checklist completion can hide real source differences. Visual QA should verify, not drive, the implementation. |

## Recommended Execution Strategy

Do not do Phase 1 in one large unverified pass. The remaining work is highly coupled and shader/render-target failures can pass build while breaking runtime or visual parity.

Recommended cadence:

- Low-risk ownership/constants/state changes: 8-10 source-proven differences per batch.
- Medium-risk shader changes: 5-8 differences per batch.
- High-risk render order, render target, or material replacement changes: 3-5 differences per batch.
- Per-block `Ka` simulation or full `VA` replacement: isolate into a dedicated batch with browser smoke and visual inspection.

## Next Batches

### Batch A: `Ka/GA` Local Simulation Ownership

Status: implemented in code, pending real WebGL visual/performance QA.

Goal: decide whether to implement source per-`GA` local mouse simulation.

Tasks:

1. Prototype per-work-item local simulation targets behind the existing `WorkItem` structure.
2. Feed each visible item its own `tMouseSim` texture.
3. Keep screen-space `tMouseSim2` shared from render manager.
4. Preserve current per-block ray-plane UV projection.
5. Add a fallback path or guard if target allocation is too expensive.

This was the highest source-parity gain left for `GA/Ka`, but it remains one of the highest runtime-risk changes until tested in a browser with a working WebGL context.

### Batch B: `A1/OA` Shader Blend Audit

Status: partially implemented. The currently used source modes are routed through a source-shaped dispatcher; final OA visual-state ownership and material flags are source-shaped; full unused blend-mode table is not ported.

Goal: reduce remaining composite shader approximations.

Tasks:

1. Port or exactly map source `blend(1, ...)` and `blend(11, ...)` used by A1.
2. Compare source A1 final color order against rebuild order after recent split bloom changes.
3. Audit whether final OA should keep darken/saturation or move that responsibility elsewhere.
4. Keep bloom chain separation intact. This remains intact after the OA/C1/Lu material flag pass.
5. Browser smoke after every shader pass change if compilation risk appears.

### Batch C: `Se` Route/Setter Ownership

Status: implemented in code, pending browser/WebGL route QA. Core setter ownership, project/home/about entry timing, about leave/destroy cleanup, and home route leave dispatch are source-shaped.

Goal: make visual state setters source-owned instead of rebuild-compensated.

Tasks:

1. Audit `Se.setProject()` against rebuild `setProject()`.
2. Audit `Se.showScene()` / `hideWorkScene()`. `showScene()` source-state tween ownership and page-enter timing are implemented; `hideWorkScene()` and route-link dispatch now follow the source `yD.onWorkGalleryOut()` / transition path shape.
3. Audit about route entry/leave setter order. `TD/Fg`-style entry reveal is now separated from setup and deferred to page-enter; animated leave and immediate destroy cleanup are now split.
4. Audit project route entry/leave setter order without regressing media pages. Initial `OD.init`-style media opacity reset and deferred `OD.animateIn`-style media reveal are implemented; project leave still follows the source `setMediaOpacity(0,.5)` / `setFluidStrength(.5)` shape.
5. Remove or document any remaining rebuild-only side effects. Core `darken/saturation/contrast/media background/directionalLight2` setter state ownership is implemented.

### Batch D: Auxiliary Visuals

Goal: improve source parity for about/floating visual scene without destabilizing home.

Tasks:

1. Implement source `Fg` scroll velocity feed for floating blocks, scoped to the about route.
2. Keep `$A`/`ZA` material and z-position behavior as implemented unless browser QA shows a mismatch.
3. Browser QA about entry, scroll, resize, and leave when a real WebGL context is available.
4. Decide whether full character scene work is required for Phase 1 or can remain a documented acceptance gap.

## Phase 1 Completion Criteria

Phase 1 should be considered complete only when:

- `p1`, `GA`, `VA`, `T1/w1/E1`, `A1/C1`, `OA/kA/Lu`, `Ka`, and `Se` each have either source-aligned implementation or documented accepted deviation.
- Build and `git diff --check` pass.
- Dist markers remain stable.
- Browser smoke passes home, about, and at least two project pages. Current local Chrome/SwiftShader smoke passes this gate.
- Project media pages retain desktop WebGL tracks and mobile media fallback.
- A final source-vs-rebuild visual QA pass confirms no obvious regressions in home WebGL, thumb projection, mouse interaction, about visual, and project media pages. Current forced-entry source screenshots are not sufficient evidence for this gate.
